## Project Overview

This data analysis aims to provide insights into  data job market, focusing on data analysts roles. The project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively, it delves into top paying and in-demand skills to help and find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.


### The Questions

1.	What are the skills most in demand for the top 3most popular data roles?
2.	How are in-demand skills trending for data Analysts
3.	Highest paid and most demanded skills for Data Analysts?
4.	What are the optimal skills for Data Analysts to learn (High demand AND High paying)

### Data Source

The The primary dataset used for this project is from Hugging face website, https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukebarousse/data_jobs

### Tools Used
To deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- Python: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights, I also used the following python libraries:
  - Pandas Library: This was used to analyze the data
  - Matplotlib Library: For visualization
  - Seaborn Library: For more advanced Visuals
- Jupyter Notebooks: To run and executing my python scripts, including my notes 

#### Data preparation and cleanup
This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accurancy and usability

#### Import and Clean up data
Importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by data cleaning tasks.
#### Filter for UK jobs
Apply filter to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United Kingdom

df_UK = df[df['job_country'] == 'United Kingdom']

### The Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for the project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Here is how I approched each questio;

#### 1. What are the most demanded skill for the top 3 most popular data roles

To find the most demanded skill for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those position by which ones popular and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular jobs titles and their top skills.

Visualize Data

~~~python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    #df_plot.plot(kind='barh',x='job_skills', y='skill_percent', ax=ax[i], title=job_title)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='Oranges_d')
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
plt.show()

#### Insights:

- Excel experienced a significant increase in demand starting around July, surpassing SQL
- SQL remain the most consistently demanded skill throughout the year, although it shows a gradual decrease in demand
- Python and power bi show relatively stable demand throughout the year with some fluctuations but remains essential skills for data analysts. Tableau, less demanded compared to the others


#### 3. Highest paid and demanded skills for Data Analysts.

Identify the highest paying roles and skills, I filtered for jobs in United Kingdom, looked at their median salary and most demanded skills.

#### Visualize Data

~~~python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)
sns.barplot(data = df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, ax=ax[0], hue='median', palette='Oranges_d')
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, ax=ax[1], hue='median', palette='Oranges')
plt.show()
